## Goals

First-Year Seminars (FYS) provide students with a hands-on introduction to academic inquiry. All seminars provide opportunities for critical reading and thinking and establish a foundation for effective written and oral communication skills, information literacy, and library research skills. All FYS Seminars have the same five common goals:
* expand and deepen students' understanding of the world and of themselves
* enhance students' ability to read and think critically
* enhance students' ability to communicate effectively, in writing, speech, and other appropriate forms
* develop the fundamentals of information literacy and library research
* provide the opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty member
## Seminar Topic
This seminar examines the lives of Christian ascetics in late antique eastern Mediterranean who espoused a set of practices called monasticism. In the narrow sense, asceticism denotes various forms of abstinence. Textual sources construe Christian ascetic practice as one that renounces the material world and traditional social structures. Literary portrayals of monasticism emphasize withdrawal, fasting, sleeplessness, ceaseless prayer, and celibacy. Monks are said to have migrated into the demon-infested desert to lead a spiritual combat against fornication and other vices. Their mortified bodies are said to have emitted “ascetic stench” that attested to their holiness. Monastic texts depict ascetic practitioners as athletes of piety to highlight their spiritual prowess. They thus allude to classical models of askesis, that is physical and intellectual training. Instead of the well-defined body of Greek and Roman athletes, the monks’ emaciated bodies stood for spiritual fitness and exuded the ethos of religiously defined masculinity. Many of the early Christian monks and nuns resided in Egypt, the “bread basket” of the Roman Empire with trade routes to virtually every corner of the Mediterranean region and beyond. The arid climate of Egypt, Sudan, Palestine, and Syria preserved substantial material remains of various expressions of monasticism, from secluded caves for hermits to enclosed communities for cenobitic practitioners.
## Course Description
In this seminar, students will explore ways in which a system of beliefs and values can affect the human condition through a set of ritual practices and spatial settings designed to enact those beliefs and values. In particular, this course asks, how do pursuits of an ideal — in this case the ascetic ideal — shape notions concerning body, gender, social structures, and built environments? For example, does social hierarchy have an impact on the hierarchy of space? What are the meaning and purpose of combat against demons, real or imagined, for identity construction? Why do perceptions of the human body and gender roles prove significant even for monastic communities whose spokespeople claimed that they had no interest in corporeal matters? Students will grapple with these questions through critical analysis of primary sources, both textual and visual. Readings for this course will include seminal monastic texts, for example the _Life of Antony_. Scholarly articles and book chapters in the disciplines of religious studies, history, archaeology, and art history will supplement these primary sources. Students will engage course content and activate their knowledge base through discussions, reading responses, and writing assignments.

## Course Materials
Course materials are available on GitHub. You can access them [here](https://github.com/aeszyman/athletes-of-piety).
## Weekly Work
Weekly Work consists of how you prepare to participate actively. It involves reading actively and responding critically to that reading in writing.
## Reading
Reading – and reading actively – is an essential part of this course. Without careful and engaged reading, all of the other components of this class are impossible. There is a large amount of reading in this class, and you need to keep up with it. I assume that everyone completes the assigned weekly readings – I want to see evidence that you have actively engaged with their ideas.
The readings listed in the course schedule are of three kinds.

| Readings  | Tasks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Background Readings  | Please take notes.  |
| Discussion Readings | Please write a reading response. |
| Assignment Readings | Please complete an assignment. |

Class discussions will focus on Discussion and Assignment Readings.

## Reading Responses

1 page double-spaced

Please upload to Richmond Box.

For each discussion reading, students will prepare a reading response. A reading response should summarize the reading and include a discussion of at least one specific passage that stood out to you. You may choose to use the questions below as a guide to the summary part of your reading response.
* What is the reading's main subject?
* What is the author's main thesis?
* What evidence has the author used to support her or his thesis?
* What are the author's main conclusions?

# Participation
It is expected that you will attend all classes, that you will prepare for classes ahead of time, that you will participate actively in class activities and discussions, and that you will take detailed notes. I will take attendance at the beginning of each class session. Absences and persistent lateness will be duly noted and will negatively affect your final grade. Should you be absent for any reason, it is your responsibility to make up the content covered in class. You are encouraged to get help from other students in class. Ask to borrow notes and discuss what you missed. If you need further clarification, please see the instructor. Participation grade includes reading responses.
# Short Writing Assignments
There will be eleven short (1-2 pages double-spaced) writing assignments in this class.
# Timeline.js
Students will create a collaborative timeline of the _Life of Antony_ using [Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/). More details will follow.
# Papers
Students will submit three papers in this course.

| Paper | Length | Due Date | Percentage |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Paper 1 | 4-5 pages double-spaced | February 25 | 10% |
| Paper 2 | 4-5 pages double-spaced | March 20 | 10% |
| Research Paper | 5-6 pages double-spaced | April 8 | 20% |

The research paper will consist of four components.

| Component | Due Date |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Research Topic and Question | March 6 |
| Annotated Bibliography and Outline | March 25 |
| Final Research Paper | April 8 |

The instructor will give students detailed feedback on each paper. Students will then have a week to revise and resubmit. If you need more time, please let the instructor know your timeline. The resubmission of revised papers is optional, but highly recommended.
# Oral Presentation
Students will give a fifteen-minute presentation in pairs. I will distribute a list of topics from which you can choose.
# Final Portfolio
You will turn in a “portfolio” of the work you have done throughout the semester. This folder or notebook should contain all papers, weekly writings, additional assignments, and in-class writings. In order to receive credit for your work you must include the original assignments that include my comments. As part of your portfolio, you will write a “portfolio cover letter” (based in part on your midterm self-evaluation), a self-evaluation in which you reflect upon the work you did in the class. In the cover letter, you will be able to state what grade you think you deserve in our seminar. This portfolio is required in order to receive credit for this course.
