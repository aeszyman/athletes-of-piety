## Goals

First-Year Seminars (FYS) provide students with a hands-on introduction to academic inquiry. All seminars provide opportunities for critical reading and thinking and establish a foundation for effective written and oral communications skills, information literacy, and library research skills. All FYS Seminars have the same five common goals:
* expand and depend students' understanding of the world and of themselves
* enhance students' ability to read and think critically
* enhance students' ability to communicate effectively, in writing, speech, and other appropriate forms
* develop the fundamentals of information literacy and library research
* provide the opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty member
## Seminar Topic
This seminar examines the lives of Christian ascetics in late antique eastern Mediterranean who espoused a set of practices called monasticism. In the narrow sense, asceticism denotes various forms of abstinence. Textual sources construe Christian ascetic practice as one that renounces the material world and traditional social structures. Literary portrayals of monasticism emphasize withdrawal, fasting, sleeplessness, ceaseless prayer, and celibacy. Monks are said to have migrated into the demon-infested desert to lead a spiritual combat against fornication and other vices. Their mortified bodies are said to have emitted “ascetic stench” that attested to their holiness. Monastic texts depict ascetic practitioners as athletes of piety to highlight their spiritual prowess. They thus allude to classical models of askesis, that is physical and intellectual training. Instead of the well-defined body of Greek and Roman athletes, the monks’ emaciated bodies stood for spiritual fitness and exuded the ethos of religiously defined masculinity. Many of the early Christian monks and nuns resided in Egypt, the “bread basket” of the Roman Empire with trade routes to virtually every corner of the Mediterranean region and beyond. The arid climate of Egypt, Sudan, Palestine, and Syria preserved substantial material remains of various expressions of monasticism, from secluded caves for hermits to enclosed communities for cenobitic practitioners.
## Course Description
In this seminar, students will explore ways in which a system of beliefs and values can affect the human condition through a set of ritual practices and spatial settings designed to enact those beliefs and values. In particular, this course asks, how do pursuits of an ideal — in this case the ascetic ideal — shape notions concerning body, gender, social structures, and built environments? For example, does social hierarchy have an impact on the hierarchy of space? What are the meaning and purpose of combat against demons, real or imagined, for identity construction? Why do perceptions of the human body and gender roles prove significant even for monastic communities whose spokespeople claimed that they had no interest in corporeal matters? Students will grapple with these questions through critical analysis of primary sources, both textual and visual. Readings for this course will include seminal monastic texts, for example the Life of Antony. Students will also work with archival and documentary material such as excavation reports and translated papyri. Scholarly articles and book chapters in the fields of religious studies, history, archaeology, and art history will supplement these primary sources. Students will engage course content and activate their knowledge base through discussions, reading responses, and writing assignments.

## Weekly Work
Weekly Work consists of how you prepare to participate actively. It involves reading actively and responding critically to that reading in writing.
## Reading
Reading – and reading actively – is an essential part of this course. Without careful and engaged reading, all of the other components of this class are impossible. There is a large amount of reading in this class, and you need to keep up with it. I assume that everyone completes the assigned weekly readings – I want to see evidence that you have actively engaged with their ideas.
The readings listed in the course schedule are of three kinds.
