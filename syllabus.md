## Goals

First-Year Seminars (FYS) provide students with a hands-on introduction to academic inquiry. All seminars provide opportunities for critical reading and thinking and establish a foundation for effective written and oral communications skills, information literacy, and library research skills. All FYS Seminars have the same five common goals:
* expand and depend students' understanding of the world and of themselves
* enhance students' ability to read and think critically
* enhance students' ability to communicate effectively, in writing, speech, and other appropriate forms
* develop the fundamentals of information literacy and library research
* provide the opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty member
