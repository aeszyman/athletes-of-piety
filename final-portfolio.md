## Final Portfolio

You will upload a “portfolio” of the work you have done throughout the semester. Please upload all files to a Box folder I have shared with each of you individually. I have already placed some of the work you turned in over the course of the semester, with my feedback, to give you a head start. This Box folder should contain all papers, weekly writings, additional assignments, and in-class writings. In order to receive credit for your work you must include the original assignments that include my comments. As part of your portfolio, you will write a “portfolio cover letter” (based in part on your midterm self-evaluation), a self-evaluation in which you reflect upon the work you did in the class (see specific questions below). In the cover letter, you will be able to state what grade you think you deserve in our seminar. This portfolio is required in order to receive credit for this course.
