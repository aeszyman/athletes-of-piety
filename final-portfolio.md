## Final Portfolio

due Sunday, May 5, midnight

You will upload a “portfolio” of the work you have done throughout the semester. Please upload all files to a Box folder I have shared with each of you individually. I have already placed some of the work you turned in over the course of the semester, with my feedback, to give you a head start. I will continue adding to your individual folders in the next few days, so check it daily. This Box folder should contain all papers, weekly writings, additional assignments, and in-class writings. In order to receive credit for your work, you must include the original assignments that include my comments.

**Portfolio Cover Letter

2 pages, double-spaced

As part of your portfolio, you will write a “portfolio cover letter” (based in part on your midterm self-evaluation), a self-evaluation in which you reflect upon the work you did in the class (see specific questions below). In the cover letter, you will be able to state what grade you think you deserve in our seminar.

1. What was your favorite background reading? Explain why.

2. How many reading responses have you submitted? Which discussion reading did you find to be most engaging? Explain why.

3. How many assignments have you submitted? Which assignment did you find to be most engaging? Explain why.

4. How many papers have you revised? What revisions have you made for each revised paper?

5. What have you learned from my feedback on you writing? Give specific examples. Two examples should address sentence-level issues (e.g. punctuation), and two examples should address big-picture issues (e.g. overarching argument).

6. What is your main takeaway about asceticism from this course? What have you learned about the world and about yourself in this course?

7. Has your ability to read and think critically improved this semester? Explain how. You can give a specific example.

8. Has this course enhanced your ability to communicate effectively, in writing, speech, and other appropriate forms? Explain how. You can give specific examples.

10. Have you met with me at the beginning and in the middle of the semester? Those two appointments were required. If you missed them, explain why you made that decision.
