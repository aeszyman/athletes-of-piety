## Mid-Semester Self-Evaluation

1-2 pages double-spaced

due March 6

How are you doing in this class? What have you done well? Upon what could you improve? Towards what grade do you think you are working? If you are uncertain where to start, please look at the course objectives stated in the syllabus. Which of these have you taken advantage of in our course so far? Which do you want to develop? Which are emphasized in your other courses? Which would you like to pursue further as your education unfolds?

Please schedule a meeting wiht the instructor. During that meeting I will look at your work to date and we will discuss your participation in class and the grade towards which you are currently working.
