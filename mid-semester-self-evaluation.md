How are you doing in this class? What have you done well? Upon what could you improve? Towards what grade do you think you are working? Due before or at the beginning of our individual mid-semester meetings, which will be held after mid-semester. During that meeting I will look at your work to date and we will discuss your participation in class and the grade towards which you are currently working. If you are uncertain where to start, please look at the course objectives stated in the syllabus. Which of these have you taken advantage of in our course so far? Which do you want to develop? Which are emphasized in your other courses? Which would you like to pursue further as your education unfolds?
