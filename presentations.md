## Presentations
Each presentation will have two parts. One part will analyze an artwork through annotation in StorymapJS. Here is an example of what that might look like: [Visual Worlds of Himalayan Buddhism](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/c3664ff4fb8971c269fa2d54e6eb1dab/chapters-4-6-bok/index.html). The other part will use the GIS mode of StorymapJS to contextualize the same artwork. The order of the two parts is up to you, but the whole presentation should be cohesive. It should also address the funamdental question of how the artwork or its context relate to the theme of asceticism. The whole presentation should not exceed sixteen minutes, and each presenter should speak for eight minutes. You will craft your presentations using StorymapJS. You are required to submit a bibliography of sources.

As you think about the selected artwork, consider the following questions:
  
* When, where, and why was the work made? By whom, and for whom?
  
* What did the work originally look like?
  
* Where would the work originally have been seen?
  
* What does the form (material, size, color, composition) contribute?
  
* What is the title? Does the title help to illuminate the work?
  
* What is the subject matter?
  
* For what purpose was this object made?

The presentations will be graded on content, clarity, and delivery.
