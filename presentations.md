## Presentations
Each presentation will have two parts. One part will analyze an artwork. The other part will contextualize that artwork. The order is up to you. The presentation should not exceed sixteen minutes, and each presenter should speak for eight minutes. You will craft your presentations using StorymapJS.

As you think about the selected artwork, consider the following questions:
  When, where, and why was the work made? By whom, and for whom?
  What did the work originally look like?
  Where would the work originally have been seen?
  What does the form (material, size, color, composition) contribute?
  What is the title? Does the title help to illuminate the work?
  What is the subject matter?
  For what purpose was this object made?
