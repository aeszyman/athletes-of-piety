# Research Project
The research project consists of three components.

| Component | Due Date |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Research Question | March 6 |
| Annotated Bibliography | March 27 |
| Outline | April 1 |
| Research Paper | April 8 |

## Possible Research Topics

1. **Historicizing Asceticism**

If you choose this option, your task wil be to undertake a research project about a historical aspect of asceticism. You can focus on a historical figure, e.g. Pachomios, or a historical place, e.g. Monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai, or an archaeological site, e.g. Kellia.

2. **Analyzing Asceticism**

If you choose this option, your task will be to analyze a work of monastic literature, e.g. _Sayings of the Desert Fathers_. You will have to support your own textual analysis with secondary and tertiary sources.

3. **Theorizing Asceticism**

If you choose this option, your task will be to undertake a research project about a theme related to the study of asceticism. Please reread Rebecca Krawiec's "Asceticism" for ideas. Examples: perceptions of the body and the senses, gender and sexuality, violence, demons, literacy.

4. **Relating Asceticism**

If you choose this option, your initial task will be to identify a modern concept, cultural practice, or element of the human condition that echoes some of what you have learned about late antique asceticism. In other words, is there anything about late antique asceticism that can inform our understanding of today's world? For example, can the concept of mindfulness be viewed through the lens of asceticism?

5. **Writing Asceticism**

If you choose this option, your task will be to compose a vita of a monastic saint. Your vita has to incorporate structural elements of the late antique prototype. You will have to support your vita with secondary and tertiary sources.

If you want to work on a different topic, you will have to obtain the instructor's approval.

## Research Question
3 sentences

Research questions help writers focus their research by providing a path through the research and writing process. The specificity of a well-developed research question helps writers avoid the “all-about” paper and work toward supporting a specific, arguable thesis. A research question is the question around which you center your research. It should be:
* **clear**: it provides enough specifics that one’s audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.
* **focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be answered thoroughly in the space the writing task allows.
* **concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
* **complex**: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
* **arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.

## Annotated Bibliography
10 sources (primary and secondary)

An annotated bibliography is a bibliography in which you include a short summary or abstract of sources you are thinking of using for a paper. It is more than a works cited list, which gives only a bibliographic citation for the source. Annotations should offer a summary of the material as well as critical comments. Critical comments should be supported by personal argument or knowledge. These annotations do one or more of the following:
* Describe the content and focus of the book, article or web site
* Suggest the source's usefulness to your research
* Evaluate the source's method, conclusions or reliability
* Record your reactions to the source

The annotated bibliography for the research project in this course has to include ten sources. The final bibliography can, and indeed should, include more sources. The sources in the annotated bibliography have to be:
* **primary** (two) and **secondary**

Tertiary sources do not count, but you should use them. If you do, you have to include them in the bibliography for the final paper.
* **scholarly** and **peer-reviewed**

Internet websites do not count, but online materials accessed through research databases such as JSTOR do.
* **printed** (at least five)
* requested through the **interlibrary loan** (at least one)
