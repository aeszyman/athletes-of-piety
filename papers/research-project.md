## Possible Research Topics

1. Historicizing Asceticism
If you choose this option, your task wil be to undertake a research project about a historical aspect of asceticism. You can focus on a historical figure, e.g. Pachomios, or a historical place, e.g. Monastery of Saint Catherine in Sinai, or an archaeological site, e.g. Kellia.

2. Analyzing Asceticism
If you choose this option, your task will be to analyze a work of monastic literature, e.g. _Sayings of the Desert Fathers_. Your will have to support your own textual analysis with secondary and tertiary sources.

3. Theorizing Asceticism
If you choose this option, your task will be to undertake a research project about a theme related to the study of asceticism. Please reread Rebecca Krawiec's "Asceticism" for ideas. Examples: perceptions of the body and the senses, gender and sexuality, violence, demons, literacy.

3. Relating Asceticism
If you choose this option, your initial task will be to identify a modern concept, cultural practice, or element of the human condition that echoes some of what you have learned about late antique asceticism. In other words, is there anything about late antique asceticism that can inform our understanding of today's world? For example, can the concept of mindfulness be viewed through the lens of asceticism?

4. Writing Asceticism
If you choose this option, your task will be to compose a vita of a monastic saint. Your vita has to incorporate structural elements of the late antique prototype.

You are welcome to work on a different topic, but your proposed topic will have to obtain the instructor's approval.
