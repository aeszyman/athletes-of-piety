4-5 pages double-spaced

due February 25

In "The _Life of Antony_: Text and Context" (background reading), William Harmless states: "The _Life of Antony_ is no modern biography. Closer in spirit to _Beowulf_ or, for that matter, _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, it is a tale of high adventure, of pitched battles against nefarious supernatural forces, set within an exotic landscape."

Do you agree or disagree with this statement? To answer this question, focus on a specific theme or motif in the _Life of Antony_. How does this theme or motif portray Antony and asceticism? Discuss at least two specific passages from the _Life of Antony_ that illustrate this theme or motif. Focus on how the selected passages express the theme or motif you have identified.

Then, write about your own reception of the _Life of Antony_. How is your reception of the _Life of Antony_ different from the work's original audience? Do you view the _Life of Antony_ as a biography, historical source, work of literature, or something else? What do you think was Athanasios's intention behind composing the _Life of Antony_? In your essay, be sure to draw on specific passages in the _Life of Antony_ to support your claims.
